The overall goal of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)  is to create a common understanding of vehicle signals in order to reach a “common language” independent of the protocol or serialisation format. 

Please find the official documentation at: [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/)

## Getting started

### Using VSS
To use a specific version of VSS in your toolchain, head over to our [releases page](https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/releases/).


**Latest release:** [2.1](https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/releases/tag/v2.1)


### Contribute to VSS
Work towards version 2.2 is continuously ongoing in the [master branch](https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/tree/master)

To work with the specification directly, you need to clone this repository.

This repository uses git submodules.  Please make sure you clone recursively,

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification
```


Alternatively, just init and update the submodules after the initial cloning:

```
git clone https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification
git submodule update --init
```
