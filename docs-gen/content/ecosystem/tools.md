VSS can be transformed into other formats or generated as code to integrate with other tooling environments and ecosystems.

The COVESA [vss-tools project](https://github.com/covesa/vss-tools) contains various helpful converters and is also used to validate the syntactic validity of the VSS standard catalogue.

If new features are introduced to the VSS specification, the community will ensure they are supported in the official vss-tools as well.
